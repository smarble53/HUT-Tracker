Public Releases of HUT-Tracker

This application tracks wins, losses, and OT losses for NHL 21 (or whatever other game you can think of), to show on a livestream.

It writes the values to .txt files in the directory for OBS to reference.

For releases, please visit https://github.com/smarble53/HUT-Tracker/releases/ to download.
