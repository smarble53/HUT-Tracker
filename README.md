# HUT-Tracker
Public Releases of HUT-Tracker
(code is not up here yet, as I'm very emberassed of my code; its just a quick and dirty project)

This application tracks wins, losses, and OT losses for NHL 21 (or whatever other game you can think of), to show on a livestream.

It writes the values to .txt files in the directory for OBS to reference.

For releases, please visit https://github.com/smarble53/HUT-Tracker/releases/ to download.
